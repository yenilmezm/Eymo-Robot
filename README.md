# Eymo-Robot
An autonomous EYMO needs to address two critical problems to survive and navigate within its surroundings:
-mapping the environment
-finding its relative location within the map.

Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a process which aims to localize an autonomous mobile EYMO in a previously unexplored environment
while constructing a consistent and incremental map of its environment. The interdependence of localization and mapping raises the complexity of the
problem and necessitate accurately solving these two problems at the same time. EYMO also solves the problems in a most efficient and economical
way while it’s completing it’s duty. EYMO creates a new path when it see a new obstacle or adapt itself to the environment. So, EYMO can handle with
all the problems that can be seen in a daily life such as people, terrain, obstacles etc.

In order to provide all necessities we developed SLAM algorithms and other needed developments like laser sensor area scanning algorithms, ultrasonic
sensor algorithms for being aware of the obstacles to stay away from them and creating a new path to reach EYMO’s purpose. We also spent time for
integrating the Robot Operating System, Arduino IDE, sensors, hardware, environment and so on. It is called task planning and means that translation of
a manufacturing plan into the EYMO operations that may allow the successful execution of the plan, involving the planning of sensory operations,
gross-motion planning with collision avoidance, and fine-motion planning with contact motions. EYMO may be used in different areas such as space and
underwater mapping in non-human places or hospitals, airports, shopping malls, companies, universities or factories as an assistant robot or as a lifting
robot.

Briefly, EYMO can create the map of the place that it’s never known before with its artificial intelligence.
